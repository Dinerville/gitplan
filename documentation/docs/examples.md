# User Authentication System

Implement secure user authentication with JWT tokens and role-based access control.

## Requirements

- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] Login/logout functionality  
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] JWT token management
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Session management

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can register with email and password
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh token mechanism is implemented
- Admin users have elevated permissions

## Technical Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates against database
3. JWT token generated and returned
4. Client stores token for subsequent requests

### Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all authentication requests
- Store refresh tokens securely
- Implement proper session invalidation

## API Endpoints

```javascript
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
POST /api/auth/refresh
POST /api/auth/reset-password
```

## Dependencies

- bcrypt for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for JWT handling
- express-rate-limit for rate limiting

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for auth service
- [ ] Integration tests for endpoints
- [ ] Security testing for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Load testing for performance
```

## Getting Started Templates

### Quick Setup Commands

Use these commands to quickly set up any of the example projects:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-gitplan-project
cd my-gitplan-project

# Initialize GitPlan with demo content
gitplan init

# Start the server
gitplan start

# Open browser to http://localhost:3057
```

### Customization Tips

- **Adapt status values**: Modify the status values in both view.json and markdown files to match your workflow
- **Add custom fields**: Include additional frontmatter fields relevant to your use case
- **Adjust colors**: Choose colors that match your brand or preferences
- **Create multiple boards**: Set up different boards for different projects or teams

## Best Practices from Examples

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, kebab-case file names
- Organize issues in directories that match board paths
- Keep board names clear and project-specific

### Status Workflows

- **Simple workflow**: `todo` â†’ `in-progress` â†’ `completed`
- **Review workflow**: `todo` â†’ `in-progress` â†’ `review` â†’ `completed`
- **GTD workflow**: `someday` â†’ `next` â†’ `waiting` â†’ `completed`

### Field Selection

- Include only essential fields in cardFields to avoid clutter
- Use priority and deadline for time-sensitive projects
- Add assignedTo for team collaboration
- Include category or tags for better organization

## Multi-Board Project Example

### Complex Project Structure

For larger projects, you might have multiple boards:

```
enterprise-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ boards/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ development.view.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ marketing.view.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ operations.view.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ leadership/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ view.json
â””â”€â”€ issues/
    â”œâ”€â”€ development/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-interface.md
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ responsive-design.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ backend/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ api-development.md
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ database-design.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ marketing/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ campaigns/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ social-media.md
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ email-marketing.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ blog-posts.md
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ case-studies.md
    â””â”€â”€ operations/
        â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring.md
        â””â”€â”€ security.md
```

### Cross-Board Issue Linking

Link related issues across boards using custom fields:

```markdown
---
title: API Development
status: in-progress
priority: high
assignedTo: backend-team
relatedIssues: ["marketing/api-documentation", "operations/api-monitoring"]
dependencies: ["database-design"]
---
```

## Integration Examples

### Git Integration

Use GitPlan with Git workflows:

```bash
# Create feature branch for new issues
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Edit issues and board configurations
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user authentication requirements"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/user-authentication
```

### CI/CD Integration

Automate board updates with CI/CD:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/update-boards.yml"
name: Update GitPlan Boards
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'issues/**'
      - 'boards/**'

jobs:
  update-boards:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to GitPlan Server
        run: |
          # Deploy updated boards to production
          rsync -av boards/ issues/ server:/path/to/gitplan/
```

## Advanced Configuration Examples

### Dynamic Filtering

Create boards that filter by multiple criteria:

```json
{
  "name": "Sprint Board",
  "path": "development",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "Sprint Backlog",
      "color": "#6b7280",
      "filters": {
        "status": ["todo", "backlog"],
        "sprint": "current-sprint"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "In Progress",
      "color": "#f59e0b",
      "filters": {
        "status": "in-progress",
        "sprint": "current-sprint"
      }
    }
  ],
  "boardFilters": {
    "sprint": ["current-sprint"],
    "assignedTo": ["team-member-1", "team-member-2"]
  }
}
```

### Custom Field Examples

Use custom fields for specific workflows:

```markdown
---
title: Database Migration
status: planning
priority: high
assignedTo: database-team
estimate: 8
complexity: high
riskLevel: medium
stakeholders: ["product-team", "ops-team"]
rollbackPlan: "migration-rollback.md"
testingRequired: true
---
```

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Common Configuration Issues

**Issue**: Board not showing issues

```json
// Problem: Status values don't match
{
  "filters": {
    "status": "in-progress"  // Board expects "in-progress"
  }
}
```

```markdown
<!-- But markdown file has: -->
---
status: "in_progress"  <!-- Uses underscore instead of hyphen -->
---
```

**Solution**: Ensure consistent status values across all files.

**Issue**: Issues appearing in wrong columns

```json
// Problem: Overlapping filters
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "To Do",
      "filters": { "status": ["todo", "backlog"] }
    },
    {
      "name": "Backlog", 
      "filters": { "status": "backlog" }  // This will never show issues
    }
  ]
}
```

**Solution**: Make column filters mutually exclusive.

### Testing Your Configuration

Create a test issue to verify your setup:

```markdown title="test-issue.md"
---
title: Test Issue
status: todo
priority: high
assignedTo: test-user
category: test
---

# Test Issue

This issue is used to test board configuration.
```

Then check:
1. Does it appear on the board?
2. Is it in the correct column?
3. Are all metadata fields displayed correctly?
