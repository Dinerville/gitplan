# Database Performance Optimization

Optimize database queries and structure to improve application performance and reduce response times.

## Current Issues
- Slow query performance on user dashboard
- Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- N+1 query problems in API endpoints
- Large table scans affecting performance

## Optimization Plan
- Add database indexes for common queries
- Implement query result caching
- Optimize JOIN operations
- Add database connection pooling
- Monitor query performance metrics

## Success Metrics
- Reduce average query time by 50%
- Eliminate queries taking >1 second
- Improve dashboard load time to <2 seconds
- Reduce database CPU usage by 30%

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze slow query log
- [ ] Add missing indexes
- [ ] Implement query caching
- [ ] Optimize complex queries
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
