# User Authentication System

Implement a secure user authentication system with login, registration, and password reset functionality.

## Requirements

- Set up email service for verification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Users can login and logout
- [ ] Password reset via email works
- [ ] Sessions persist across browser restarts
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

## Progress
- ‚úÖ Set up authentication middleware
