# Read 24 Books This Year

Challenge myself to read 24 books this year (2 per month) to expand knowledge and improve focus.

- Non-fiction: 12 books
- Technical: 4 books

## Progress

- Listen to audiobooks during commute
- Join local book club for accountability
- Track progress in reading journal
